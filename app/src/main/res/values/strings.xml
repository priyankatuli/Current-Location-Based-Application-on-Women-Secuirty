        <ul>
            <li>If you are attacked, go for the eyes, throat, and legs</li>

            \n\n<li>If you are alone, donâ€™t have bags over your shoulders that can pull you over. Have the bag hanging loose so you can easily drop it</li>

            \n\n<li>If someone grabs you around the throat, pull at one finger, not the hand</li>

            \n\n<li>If you can kick the attacker, aim for the knee</li>

            \n\n<li>If you are alone then use something you may have in your bag such as nail file, scissors, pins or brooches, scent bottles that can squirt in the eyes, Spanish spiked hair combs, etc</li>

            \n\n<li>If you scream, call a name to make your attacker think there is someone near you</li>
            \n\n<li>If the situation is suitable and it is a threatened knife attack, wrap a coat around your arm as a shield</li>

            \n\n<li>If you are attacked from behind, try and stamp on the attackers foot hard</li>

            \n\n<li>If you have keys in your hand, use these to scratch the attacker</li>

            \n\n<li>Keep your small bag mirror in your hand so you can check if you are being followed</li>

            \n\n<li>If the road is clear, walk in the middle of the road</li>

            \n\n<li>If you are carrying a handbag, remove money, keys, address books, phone, and keep these tucked in other clothing. Giving the bag may give you enough time to escape</li>

            \n\n<li>If you are on the phone, keep talking about your location</li>

            \n\n<li>If you are in a strangers car, photo the car and number plate even if it is a taxi</li>
            \n\n<li>Also try to remember a description of the driver. Age, colour, weight, height, accent, clothes, accessories, tattoos, etc</li>
        </ul>
